This notebook contains the final code for an IoT project, including various stages of data analysis, preprocessing, and visualization. Below is an overview of the key sections and activities within the notebook:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and NumPy
Initial data exploration and manipulation using NumPy.
Various code cells performing data inspection and basic operations.
Handling Missing Values
Methods to identify and handle missing data in the dataset.
Code snippets showing different approaches to address missing values.
Data Visualization and Preprocessing
Visualizing the data to gain insights and prepare it for further analysis.
Handling outliers and extreme data points.
Several code cells dedicated to plotting and preprocessing steps.
Seasonal Analysis
Analyzing data based on climatological seasons (Winter, Summer, Monsoon, Post-monsoon) assumed to be collected in India.
Hourly data segmentation into four segments: Night, Morning, Afternoon, and Evening.
The notebook is structured with markdown explanations and code cells to provide a comprehensive analysis of the IoT data, making it easier to follow the steps and understand the data transformation processes.
